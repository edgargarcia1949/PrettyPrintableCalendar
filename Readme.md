**Motivation:**

I wanted to make an attractive calendar for my spouse to put on the refrigerator to help keep track of upcoming events.



**Motivation2:**

I also wanted to learn Python and thought that writing a calendar program would be a good thing to do.



**Features:**

Easy to use and has attractive display.

Small footprint and no need to install.

Has holidays and events which can be entered in 2 ways.

Automatically adjusts row height in month.

Can easily go from any month and any year above 999.

Up arrow key can toggle text boxes and buttons.

Down arrow key can create printable file with png extension.

All user inputs are stored and retrieved from txt file.

Comments can be deleted from that txt file during run.

Holiday and Event files are checked for accuracy at start.

Starts in current month and year with today highlighted.



**How to run:**

Double click on ppc.exe to run in Windows.

In Linux, follow instructions in Instructions.txt file.



**Things I would like to do:**

I would like the print out feature to automatically print out a perfect calendar month and not have to convert the png file.

I would like to be able to write my own input module and not rely on "pygame-widgets" which has become a problem as written about in the Instructions.txt file.

I would also like to produce a European calendar where I understand the week starts on Monday.
